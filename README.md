# -Ski-Resort-Management-System

This repository contains a Spring Boot project for a ski resort management system, developed as a part of our school project. The system is designed to manage a ski resort's operations, including ski courses, skier registrations, and instructor assignments. The project implements core concepts of object-oriented design and database management, as illustrated in our class diagram.

Key Features:

Ski courses management, including course type, difficulty level, duration, and pricing.
Skier registration and subscription options (annual, monthly, or semi-annual).
Instructor information and assignment to courses.
Week-based registration for ski courses.
Comprehensive data management for skiers, instructors, and ski courses.
