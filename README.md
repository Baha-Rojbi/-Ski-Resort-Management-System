# -Ski-Resort-Management-System
This repository contains the source code for our school project, an "Etude de cas" focused on a Ski Resort Management System. In this project, we have developed a Spring Boot application that simulates the operations of a ski resort. The system handles ski course management, skier registrations, instructor details, and more.
